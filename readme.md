My personal website, now written in Laravel

## Todo
- [ ] remove path from filename in photos table
- [ ] thumbnails for gallery and staging view -- will probably require GD
- [ ] remove exif from photos
- [ ] replace uploaded photo from file, keeping all other data
- [ ] add alttext field to photos table, add alttext missing filter to staging view
- [ ] maybe change how the filters work in staging view
- [ ] pagination for staging view?
- [ ] check if title is unique in "new post" frontend via some js or something like that
- [x] get old frontends of the website to work with the current database
- [ ] tag filter reset button
- [ ] unify look of description with comments
- [ ] clean up photo view page, e.g. spacing around tags and description, back to overview button
- [ ] add location information to photos?
- [ ] make posts page load quicker
