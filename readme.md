# Pascal Sommer Photography website

My personal website, now written in Laravel

## Todo
* remove path from filename in photos table
* thumbnails for gallery and staging view -- will probably require GD
* remove exif from photos
* add alttext field to photos table, add alttext missing filter to staging view
* replace photo from file
* maybe change how the filters work in staging view
* pagination for staging view?
* get old frontends of the website to work with the current database
* tag filter reset button
* unify look of description with comments
* clean up photo view page, e.g. spacing around tags and description, back to overview button
* add location information to photos?
* make posts page load quicker
