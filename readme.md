# Pascal Sommer Photography website

[My photography blog](https://photography.pascalsommer.ch), now written in Laravel

## Development Setup

```bash
# Create .env file from example
cp laravel/.env{.example,}

# Let the server write to these directories
chmod a+w -R laravel/storage/{framework,logs}
chmod a+w -R img/photos/

# Quickly set up a mysql server
sudo docker run --rm -d --name blog-mysql -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=root -e MYSQL_DATABASE=blog mysql
sudo docker exec -i blog-mysql sh -c 'exec mysql -uroot -proot blog' < dump.sql

# Start a container in which we can use yarn and npx
sudo docker run --rm -it --name blog-node -v $PWD:/home/node/app node bash
# su node
# cd ~/app/laravel
# yarn
# npm run prod

# Generate SVG icons
cd laravel/tools/generate-icons
cargo run

# Update php dependencies
sudo docker run --rm -it --name blog-composer -v $PWD/laravel:/app/ prooph/composer:7.4 update
```

## Front-End

The js and sass source files are located in `laravel/resources/`, and the generated output will go to the `/js`, `/css`, and `/fonts` directories. To compile, type:

```bash
cd laravel
yarn
npm run prod
```

Note that `/js/keyboardShortcuts.js` and `/js/setPhotoDimensions.js` are currently not generated, but rather developed there in place. This will hopefully change soon(ish).

## Todo
- [ ] pagination: jump to start/end
- [ ] visual indication for tags that reduce the nr. of results to zero when selected
- [x] random photo button
- [ ] check if we can actually entirely remove the dependency on eloquent-sortable
- [ ] test blacklist (see error at 2018-05-12 21:19:36, unexpected '->' at BlacklistController.php:40)
- [x] clean up css
- [ ] generate keyboardShortcuts.js and setPhotoDimensions.js through typescript
- [x] replace default laravel login page with something fitting the overall design
- [ ] remove path from filename in photos table
- [ ] store photo dimensions in db or cache them somewhere
- [ ] thumbnails for gallery and staging view -- will probably require GD
- [ ] remove exif from photos
- [ ] reencode images with progressive jpg
- [ ] replace uploaded photo from file, keeping all other data
- [ ] add alt-text according to [these guidelines](https://axesslab.com/alt-texts/) to photos, add alt-text missing filter to staging view
- [ ] maybe change how the filters work in staging view
- [ ] pagination for staging view?
- [ ] check if title is unique in "new post" frontend via some js or something like that
- [x] get old frontends of the website to work with the current database
- [x] tag filter reset button
- [x] clean up photo view page, e.g. spacing around tags and description, back to overview button. Description could look like a comment (copying a bit of instagram's aesthetic), also make sure to use the horizontal space.
- [ ] add location information to photos?
- [ ] make posts page load quicker
